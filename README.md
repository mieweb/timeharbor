## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

TimeHarbor addresses critical needs in modern institutional knowledge management and accountability:

**Core Mission**
- Enable individuals to document, reflect on, and communicate the value of their time investment
- Provide transparent, consent-driven time tracking that respects privacy by default
- Facilitate institutional knowledge transfer and activity documentation
- Support team coordination and progress tracking without surveillance

**Why TimeHarbor Exists**
Traditional time tracking solutions treat individuals as subjects to be monitored. TimeHarbor inverts this model—your data belongs to you. You decide what gets recorded, how it's categorized, and who gets to see it. This philosophy makes TimeHarbor uniquely suited for organizations that trust their people and believe transparency should flow both ways.

**Institutional Problems Solved**
- **Knowledge Loss**: Capture institutional procedures and training materials before experts leave
- **Communication Gap**: Help team members advocate for themselves and their contributions
- **Privacy Concerns**: Time tracking that doesn't feel like surveillance
- **Accountability**: Transparent activity documentation with user consent
- **Team Coordination**: Real-time awareness of team activities and workloads
- **Grant Reporting**: Generate detailed time and activity reports for funding agencies

## 📊 Core Concepts

### Sessions (Clock Events)
A **session** represents a continuous period of tracked time. When you "clock in," you're starting a session. Sessions accumulate time continuously and contain one or more tickets.

**Session Lifecycle:**
- Clock In → Session starts with `startTimestamp`
- Add Tickets → Allocate session time to specific work items
- Pause/Resume → Can be paused within an active session
- Clock Out → Session ends with `endTime`, accumulating total time
- Auto-Stop → Automatic safety stop after 8 continuous hours (burnout prevention)

### Tickets (Activities)
**Tickets** are work items that exist within sessions. They represent specific, named pieces of work. Multiple tickets can be active within a single session, with time being allocated across them.

**Ticket Features:**
- Title and optional GitHub/external URL
- Time accumulation across multiple work sessions
- Session breakdown showing exactly when work occurred
- Linked to specific teams and creators

```javascript
// Ticket structure in database
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  teamId: String,
  title: String,           // "Implement login feature"
  github: String,          // Optional external link
  accumulatedTime: Number, // Total seconds spent
  createdBy: String,       // User ID
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Teams
**Teams** are organizational units that group members and track collective activities.

**Team Features:**
- Unique alphanumeric code for easy member joining
- Admin role for team management
- Member list with role assignments
- Independent time tracking per team
- Shared activity visibility within team

```javascript
// Team structure
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  code: String,           // Unique join code
  members: [UserId],      // All team members
  admins: [UserId],       // Admin members
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Clock Events
**Clock Events** form the core data structure linking sessions, time, and tickets. When you clock in, you create a clock event that tracks:

```javascript
// Clock Event structure
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: String,
  teamId: String,
  startTimestamp: Number,    // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
  endTime: Date,             // Null if active
  accumulatedTime: Number,   // Total seconds in this session
  tickets: [                 // Array of tickets worked on
    {
      ticketId: String,
      startTimestamp: Number,
      accumulatedTime: Number,
      sessions: [            // Time blocks for this ticket
        {
          startTimestamp: Number,
          endTimestamp: Number
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### User Roles
- **Individual User**: Primary role—tracks personal time, controls all data sharing
- **Team Member**: Part of a team, contributes to team activities
- **Team Admin**: Manages team settings, invites members, views all team data
- **System Admin**: Manages users and system-wide settings

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Privacy First Architecture
- **No Tracking by Default**: Nothing is tracked until explicitly clocked in
- **User-Controlled Sharing**: All team members implicitly see within-team activity only
- **Data Ownership**: Individual users retain full ownership of their time data
- **Explicit Consent**: No data harvesting or background collection

### Security Measures
- **Authentication**: Secure email/password accounts with Meteor's account system
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) on teams and admin functions
- **Session Management**: Automatic session expiration after 90 days of inactivity
- **Firebase Security**: FCM tokens secured with Firebase Admin SDK
- **VAPID Keys**: Web Push notifications secured with VAPID key pairs
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit (production environment)
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: No analytics, no ads, no data selling

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage**: Password hashing with bcrypt via Meteor.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with authentication credentials
- **Backup**: Self-hosted with full control over data location
- **Compliance Ready**: Designed for GDPR and institutional data policies

### What TimeHarbor Does NOT Do
- ❌ Monitor keyboard or mouse activity
- ❌ Take screenshots or capture screen content
- ❌ Track location or device movements
- ❌ Sell data to third parties
- ❌ Use data for targeted advertising
- ❌ Share information without explicit user action
- ❌ Enable "always-on" activity tracking

## 🛠️ Development

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
# Standard development (web only)
meteor

# With settings
meteor --settings settings.json

# Verbose output for debugging
meteor --verbose

# Specific port
meteor --port 3000
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests once
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
npm run test-app

# Run specific test file (create test files in tests/)
npm run test -- --grep "description"
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Standard production build
meteor build --directory --server https://yourdomain.com

# With visualization of bundle size
npm run visualize
```

### Code Organization Best Practices

**Client Code**
- Place UI components in `client/components/[feature]/`
- Keep utilities in `client/utils/`
- Use Blaze templates for reactive UI
- Leverage ReactiveVar for component state

**Server Code**
- Group related methods in `server/methods/[domain].js`
- Place shared utilities in `server/utils/`
- Use async/await for database operations
- Validate all user input with `check()`

**Shared Code**
- Define collections in `collections.js`
- Both client and server can import from here
- Keep collection definitions simple

---

## 📝 Configuration

### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

**For Android notifications:**

1. Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Generate Android credentials and download `google-services.json`
3. Place in project root
4. Add credentials to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "private": {
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n...\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n",
    "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  }
}
```

### Web Push Notifications

**For web (desktop/browser) notifications:**

1. Generate VAPID key pair:

```bash
# Using web-push CLI
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

2. Add to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "public": {
    "vapidPublicKey": "PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
  },
  "private": {
    "VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY": "PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
    "VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY": "PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
  }
}
```

### Tailwind CSS Customization

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize theme:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#006bff',
        // Add custom colors
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [require('daisyui')],
  daisyui: {
    themes: ['light', 'dark']
  }
}
```

### Mobile Configuration

Edit `mobile-config.js` to configure Cordova app:

```javascript
App.info({
  name: 'TimeHarbor',
  description: '...',
  version: '1.0.0',
  author: 'Your Name'
});

// iOS minimum version
App.setPreference('deployment-target', '13.0', 'ios');

// Add custom permissions
App.setPermission('CAMERA', 'android');
```

---

```javascript
// tests/clock-events.tests.js
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'meteor/meteortesting:mocha';
import { ClockEvents } from '../collections.js';

describe('Clock Events', () => {
  it('should create a new clock event', () => {
    const id = ClockEvents.insert({ userId: 'test' });
    expect(id).to.exist;
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test

# Watch mode with auto-rerun
npm run test-app

# Run with specific grep pattern
npm run test -- --grep "Clock"
```

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Features

### Meteor DDP (Distributed Data Protocol)

TimeHarbor uses Meteor's real-time synchronization for:

- **Live Session Updates**: Clock in/out events broadcast to team members
- **Automatic UI Updates**: Templates reactively update when data changes
- **Subscription System**: Efficient data streaming to connected clients
- **Method Calls**: Secure RPC calls to server with validation

### Example: Real-Time Clock Event

```javascript
// Server publishes active sessions
Meteor.publish('activeClockEvents', function(teamId) {
  return ClockEvents.find({ teamId, endTime: null });
});

// Client subscribes and auto-updates
this.subscribe('activeClockEvents', teamId);

// Data automatically syncs via DDP
const active = ClockEvents.find({ teamId, endTime: null });
```

### Push Notifications

**Integration Points**
- Team member clocks in → Admins notified
- Long session detected → User warned and auto-clocked out
- System alerts → Can be configured per user

**Implementation**
- **Web Push**: Uses VAPID keys and browser notifications API
- **FCM**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for mobile devices
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works fine if notifications fail

---

## 📱 Mobile & Platform Support

### Responsive Design

TimeHarbor uses Tailwind CSS for mobile-first responsive design:

- **Mobile**: 320px+ (phones)
- **Tablet**: 768px+ (iPad, Android tablets)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (laptops, desktops)
